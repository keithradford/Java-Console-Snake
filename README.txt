This is a simple version of the game snake made using Java, played in a terminal.
This project served as practice with object-oriented programming and general programming practices.

### TO DO:

    - Game over when snake collides with itself
    - Stop food from sometimes spawning where the snake is, causing there to be no food
    - Improve scoring system
    - Make custom board sizes
    
### FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Implement "AI" mode which determines all moves ahead of time and iterates through them
      similar to Battlesnake.
