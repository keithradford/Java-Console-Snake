This is a simple Java console version of the game Snake.
This current version is roughly 95% complete.

TO DO:

    -Game Over (When snake collides with itself)
    -Stop food from sometimes spawning where the snake is, causing there to be no food

The idea of this project was to continue to grow my knowledge and skills regarding Java. 
This project was created with classes, data structures, and basic algorithms, and has expanded my knowledge 
in all of these fields, and was a way to learn how to detect and work with user keyboard inputs. I plan to attempt to transfer this game into JavaScript
as a way to learn and work with that programming language.
