# Console Snake

This is a simple version of the game snake made using Java, played in a terminal.
This project served as practice with object-oriented programming and general programming practices.

This was one of my first projects after learning how to code, thus I have plans to revisit this to make improvements and implement better practices.

### TO DO:

- Clean up code.
- Game over when snake collides with itself
- Stop food from sometimes spawning where the snake is, causing there to be no food
- Improve scoring system
- Make custom board sizes

### FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:

- Implement "AI" mode which determines all moves ahead of time and iterates through them
      similar to Battlesnake.
- Implement UI
